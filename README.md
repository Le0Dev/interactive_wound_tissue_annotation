# Interactive wound tissue annotation with one-vs-rest Superpixel Grabcut

This notebook facilitates the annotation of various tissues within a wound using masks and annotation scribbles. Each color used in the scribble represents a distinct class. Consequently, it becomes feasible to retrieve annotated superpixels and perform binary segmentation utilizing the GrabCut algorithm based on HSV color space characteristics. Employing a one-vs-rest strategy enables accomplishing multiclass segmentation. Nonetheless, this method's drawback lies in the potential existence of unclassified superpixels or those classified into multiple classes. This issue can be addressed by executing a secondary classification of problematic superpixels learned from well-classified ones (not yet implemented). Users can adjust segmentation granularity via parameters such as the number of superpixels and compactness (SLIC). However, it's crucial to rectify the risk posed by too few superpixels, which may lead to overlapping when two scribbles are present on the same superpixel. Notably, this code functions effectively when a single connected component is present on the mask; it does not handle scenarios where multiple wounds or particles coexist on the input mask simultaneously.
